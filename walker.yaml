# The Walker Configuration File
#
# Walker was made to run with sensible default values, so most configuration
# keys are documented here but commented out. The values set here are the
# defaults.

# Whether to dynamically add new-found domains (or their links) to the crawl (a
# broad crawl) or discard them, assuming desired domains are manually seeded.
#add_new_domains: false

# The number of entries to keep in the CassandraDatastore's LRU cache of
# domains, preventing us from querying too frequently to see if we already have
# them.
#added_domains_cache_size: 20000

# Maximum number of entries to hold when we cache domain name resolutions
#max_dns_cache_entries: 20000

# Configure the User-Agent header
#user_agent: Walker (http://github.com/iParadigms/walker)

# Configure which formats this crawler Accepts
#accept_formats: ["text/html", "text/*"]

# Which link to accept based on protocol (a.k.a. schema)
#accept_protocols: ["http", "https"]

# Crawl delay (in seconds) to use when unspecified by robots.txt
#default_crawl_delay: 1

# Maximum size of http content
#max_http_content_size_bytes

# For the purpose of parsing out links for crawling, walker looks at the
# following tags:
#   - a, area, form, frame, iframe, script, link, img
# It ignores several by default.
#ignore_tags: [script, img, link]

# The maximum number of links to parse from a page for further crawling.
#max_links_per_page: 1000

# How many simultaneous fetchers will your crawlmanager run
#num_simultaneous_fetchers: 10

# If true, walker will not crawl domains that resolve in private IP ranges
#blacklist_private_ips: true

## Dispatcher configuration
#dispatcher:
#    ## maximum number of links added to segments table per dispatch (must be >0)
#    num_links_per_segment: 500
#   
#    ## refresh_percentage is the percentage of links added per dispatch that have already been crawled.
#    ## So refresh_percentage = 25 means that 25% of the links added to segments on the next dispatch
#    ## will be refreshed (i.e. already crawled) links. This value must be >= 0 and <= 100.
#    refresh_percentage: 25
#
#    ## How many concurrent dispatching threads will be run at once (must be >0)
#    num_concurrent_domains: 1

# Cassandra configuration for the datastore.
# Generally these are used to create a gocql.ClusterConfig object
# (https://godoc.org/github.com/gocql/gocql#ClusterConfig).
#
# keyspace shouldn't generally need to be changed; it is mainly changed in
# testing as an extra layer of safety.
#
# replication_factor is used when defining the keyspace.
#cassandra:
#    hosts: ["localhost"]
#    keyspace: "walker"
#    replication_factor: 3

## Console specific config
#console:
#    port: 3000
#    template_directory: console/templates
#    public_folder: console/public
